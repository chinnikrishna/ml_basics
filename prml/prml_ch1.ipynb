    "3) <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: In supervised learning, training data has both input and target variables available. We have to find a mapping between input and target data both in classification and regression problmes\n",

    "4) <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: In unsupervised learning, the goal is to discover groups of similar examples within the data i.e., clustering or density estimation"
